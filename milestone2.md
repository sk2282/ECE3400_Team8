# Milestone 2: Treasure and Wall Detection

## Objective:
The goal of this milestone is to implement treasure detection at three frequencies (7kHz, 12kHz, 17kHz) and wall detection to our robot.

## Treasure Detection:

## Wall Detection:
* We first tested three IR sensors:  
  * Short range IR  
  * Regular IR  
  * Long range IR  
* We then printed readings from the sensors at three different distances from a wall: 2, 6, and 12 inches  
  * We determined which IR sensors would work best for our robot, prioritizing the best range for the distances that our robot would interact with  
  * We decided to use two short range sensors on the sides and one regular sensor on the front  
* We wrote some code to test wall detection  
  * To test the implementation, we mounted one short range sensor on the robot's right side  
  * [The robot should follow a straight line until the sensor detects a wall and stop when the wall is detected](https://youtu.be/_vbiJvubCpY)
