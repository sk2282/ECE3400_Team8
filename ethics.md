## Elderly Care Robots

### Background

### Utilitarian Test

### Applying the Test

#### Possible Alternative Actions 
	Instead of a personal caregiver one could stay in a hospital or retirement home. 
	The elderly could live with their children/Family, however this is not always an available option for them.
	Robot Caregivers
#### Stake Holders
The elderly who struggle to take care of themselves will be affected. Especially those that cannot afford personal care
3. For each of the most promising alternatives, determine the benefits and costs to all stake holders. 
	Forcing People to be caregivers
#### Possible Outcomes
People who are unhappy in their jobs do not perform as well and can experience personal consequences (https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2016/03/03/hate-your-job-heres-what-its-costing-you/#3a72d4396630)
Due to this, the elderly wonâ€™t receive the quality of care they might need.
2. Should include both short-term and long-term consequences 
List some things from the forbes article above.
3. Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stake
 Holders
The outcome of this option hella sucks. No one is happy.

Living with Family
1. Predict probable outcomes based on facts and experience 
The family might not know how exactly to handle the needs of the elderly or how to care properly for them. 
2. Should include both short-term and long-term consequences 
Distance created between family members
Added stress
3. Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stake
 Holders
People might start happier in this situation but final result would not be good



#### Ask what would happen if the action were a policy for all similar situations. 
##### First example often turns into a standard. 
#### Draw a conclusion 
##### If the same action is selected in Steps 3 & 4, then this is the ethical action. 
#####. If different actions are selected, then decide whether the individual action or the policy will produce the greatest good and the least harm, for all affected, over the long term
