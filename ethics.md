## Elderly Care Robots

### Background
Countries are trying to cope with the growing elderly population. In the United States, approximately 13% of the population is 65 years or older, but that percentage is expected to nearly double by the year 2050. This problem is not unique to the United States as 20% of the population in Japan is 65 years or older. Additionally by the year 2025, Japan expects to have a shortage of 1 million caregivers. Thus there is a growing need to find a way to adequately provide care to the elderly who need it. To confront the issue, there are numerous possibilities that supplement personal caregivers. Alternatives include the elderly living with family, forcing an increase individuals to become personal caregivers, and the utilization of personal care robots to help care for the elderly.

### Stake Holders
* The elderly who struggle to take care of themselves
* Relatives 

### Utilitarian Test
We have chosen to apply the utilitarian test. This test considers all current and future stakeholders. In this case, this is extremely important since the elderly population is growing so the outcome of this test will only affect more people as time goes on. This test also takes happiness into consideration. This is an important factor to consider because so many people will be affected. The solution that creates the most happiness will be the most desired outcome since it will affect the most people. It will cater to the common case instead of outliers.  

### Applying the Test

#### 1. Possible Alternative Actions 
* Instead of a personal caregiver one could stay in a hospital or retirement home
* The elderly could live with their children/Family, however this is not always an available option for them.
* Requiring people to be caregivers
* Robot Caregivers  

#### 2. Identify the stakeholders who will be affected by these actions 
The elderly who struggle to take care of themselves will be affected. Especially those that cannot afford personal care

#### 3. Benefits and Costs to Stake Holders	

##### Forcing Elderly into a hospital or retirement home
###### *Possible Outcome*
* Some elderly do not want to join an assisted living facility and have trouble adjusting. A study shows that some seniors have had sleep disturbances which lead to a greater need for assistance and/or depression.

* An increase in those who need to use hospital/retirement homes/etc. will make assisted living facilities filled closer and closer to capacity. Increase in individuals using assisted living facilities will increase the price of care and make it unobtainable to some who need it 
###### *Short-term and Long-term Consequences*
* An increase to those using a given facility may decrease the quality of care within it
* Represents the same problem with personal caregiver: An increase in the amount of elderly using facilities would lead to an increase in the amount of caregivers required within the assisted living facility which may lead to a shortage of staff
* Financial burden placed on those who pay for the person’s care
* Harder for family members and friends to visit, but they do not have to personally provide care to the individual 
* The quality of an assisted living facility can range greatly from place to place but some potential benefits are intellectual stimulation, nutritious meals, physical fitness, and social activity. [Source](https://www.aplaceformom.com/blog/4-22-16-assisted-living-better-health-and-happiness/)  
* Possibly easier to be social with other individuals in assisted living but that ranges depending on the facility. The negative extreme is a feeling of isolation if the person does not have an opportunity to really socialize. 
###### *Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stakeHolders*
* Some elderly do not want to utilize assisted living/prefer to stay more independent and would therefore will be unhappy despite quality of care within the place
* Happiness ranges greatly depending on the quality of the facility care and opportunity to meet other people
* Even if care for health related reasons is adequate, it may be emotionally difficult to be away from loved ones and result in a feeling of isolation (depends on degree of ability to meet other people in place)
* Long-term financial expenses may represent a burden to either the person requiring care and/or their family members

##### Requiring People to Become Caregivers
###### *Possible Outcomes*
* People who are unhappy in their jobs do not perform as well and can experience personal consequences [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2016/03/03/hate-your-job-heres-what-its-costing-you/#3a72d4396630)  
* Due to this, the elderly won’t receive the quality of care they might need.
###### *Short-term and Long-term Consequences*
* Health problems for the caregivers who are unhappy with their job
* Inadequate care and negative impact on the elderly because caregivers are unqualified/don’t care
###### *Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stakeHolders*
* Both the person seeking care and the person providing care has a great potential to be unhappy in this situation
* Family members impacted negatively if care is inadequate 

##### Living with Family
###### *Possible Outcomes*
* The family might not know how exactly to handle the needs of the elderly or how to care properly for them which can lead to inadequate care. A report shows that almost three quarters of family caregivers did not go to the doctor as often as they were suppose to. 
* Stress on the family member providing care can have a negative impact on their own health and lead to a greater potential of illness. A study shows that 23% of family caregivers caring for loved ones for 5 years or more report their own health as either fair or poor. Additionally, stress of caregiving for a person with dementia can affect a person's immune system for up to three years after caregiving ends.

###### *Short-term and Long-term Consequences*
* Distance/tension created between family members
* Added stress  
* Family members take on more than a financial burden because they have to sacrifice significant time to provide care
###### *Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stakeHolders*
* People might start happier in this situation but final result would not be good
* The elderly might be happier in this situation compared to alternatives where they would scarcely see their family, but there is also the potential that they feel like a burden or feel guilty for the need of constant care
* It would be harder on the other family members who have to provide constant care

##### Robot Caregivers
###### *Possible Outcomes* 
* Robot caregivers will increase in popularity to help supplement the shortage of personal caregivers
###### *Short-term and Long-term consequences*
* Helps to solve the caregiver employment shortage 
* Family members and loved ones can spend more meaningful time with the elderly because the robot can be delegated for the more mundane tasks they would normally have to do.
* Adequate but also consistent care that may not be provided by a human. Care can be provided 24/7 unlike by a personal caregiver. [Source](http://www.businessinsider.com/robot-caregivers-for-the-elderly-10-years-away-2017-8)
###### *Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stakeHolders*
* The most people end up happy in this situation because the elderly has the time to social with family and friends while also getting quality care

#### 4. Ask what would happen if the action were a policy for all similar situations. 
##### First example often turns into a standard. So consider what would happen immediately if these actions were to be implemented
##### Forcing Elderly into a hospital or retirement home
* Inadequate care may be provided because so many individuals would be using hospitals/retirement homes/etc.
* The elderly may not be happy if they were forced and did not want to use an assisted living facility
##### Requiring People to Become Caregivers
* Unhappy caregivers give inaequate care which can lead to health problems for the elderly
##### Living with Family
* This ranges greatly depending on family unit
* Worst case is that there is a lot of tension and disputes between famliy members. Adequate care is not provided because family members are not trained professionals. Leads to a negative impact on the elderly and loved ones.
##### Robot Caregivers
* Notoriety will increase over time as there are new innovations 
* If adequate testing is done prior and first implementation runs relatively smoothly, robot caregivers will increase in popularity and be considered a new viable option to personal caregivers

#### 5. Draw a conclusion 
##### Options to Drawing a Conclusion
1. If the same action is selected in Steps 3 & 4, then this is the ethical action. 
2. If different actions are selected, then decide whether the individual action or the policy will produce the greatest good and the least harm, for all affected, over the long term
##### The conclusion is that robot caregivers are a viable option to personal caregivers. They provide adequate and consist care. Of the options considered, it represents the option that mitigates unqualified/inadequate care while leading to the greatest number of people being happy.
