# Ethics

## Elderly Care Robots

### Background

### Stake Holders
* The elderly who struggle to take care of themselves
* Relatives 

### Utilitarian Test
We have chosen to apply the utilitarian test. This test considers all current and future stakeholders. In this case, this is extremely important since the elderly population is growing so the outcome of this test will only affect more people as time goes on. This test also takes happiness into consideration. This is an important factor to consider because so many people will be affected. The solution that creates the most happiness will be the most desired outcome since it will affect the most people. It will cater to the common case instead of outliers.  

### Applying the Test

#### Possible Alternative Actions 
* Instead of a personal caregiver one could stay in a hospital or retirement home
* The elderly could live with their children/Family, however this is not always an available option for them.
* Robot Caregivers  
* Requiring people to be caregivers

#### Benefits and Costs to Stake Holders	
##### Requiring People to Become Caregivers
###### Possible Outcomes
People who are unhappy in their jobs do not perform as well and can experience personal consequences [Source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleystahl/2016/03/03/hate-your-job-heres-what-its-costing-you/#3a72d4396630)  
Due to this, the elderly wonâ€™t receive the quality of care they might need.

###### Short-term and Long-term Consequences 
List some things from the forbes article above.

###### Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stakeHolders
The outcome of this option hella sucks. No one is happy.

##### Living with Family
###### Possible Outcomes
The family might not know how exactly to handle the needs of the elderly or how to care properly for them. 
###### Short-term and Long-term Consequences 
Distance created between family members
Added stress
3. Should consider the relative value of an outcome to different stakeHolders
People might start happier in this situation but final result would not be good



#### Ask what would happen if the action were a policy for all similar situations. 
##### First example often turns into a standard. 
#### Draw a conclusion 
##### If the same action is selected in Steps 3 & 4, then this is the ethical action. 
#####. If different actions are selected, then decide whether the individual action or the policy will produce the greatest good and the least harm, for all affected, over the long term
